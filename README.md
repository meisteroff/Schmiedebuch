## Structure
Every topic that is covered has its own package within the ***src*** directory of this repository. Therein one can find example code and the ***README.md*** files which discuss or explain my findings on these topics.

The items in the ***Table of contents*** link directly to these directories.

## Requirements
The example code requires **[Java 8 (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)** to be run. The **[Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/)** should be used for maximum compatibility with the provided project settings.

**[LibGDX](http://www.libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)** is used and provided in the ***libgdx*** directory of this repository. When importing the project within Eclipse there should be no need to setup the LibGDX files.
